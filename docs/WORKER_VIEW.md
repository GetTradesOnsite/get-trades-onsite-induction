# Worker View – First Draft

## Purpose
The Worker View is a smartphone-first interface that allows construction workers to complete a site induction in their own language, with minimal friction and clear legal confirmation.

No account creation. No passwords. No training required.

---

## Entry Point
- Worker scans a **QR code** displayed on site
- QR opens a **web page** in the phone browser
- Worker is automatically joined to an active induction session

---

## Language Selection
- First screen shows large language buttons
- Languages are configurable per site
- Once selected, the language is locked for the session
- UI text and induction content are translated live

---

## Induction Content View
- Content is **presenter-controlled**
- Worker cannot skip ahead
- Slides / text update in real time
- Layout is high-contrast and readable outdoors
- No scrolling during live presentation (auto-sync)

---

## Understanding Confirmation
- At defined points, the worker is prompted to confirm:
  - “I understand”
- Confirmation requires:
  - Tap + timestamp
- Confirmation is recorded per section

---

## Completion
- At the end of the induction:
  - Worker confirms final understanding
  - Session is marked complete
- A completion message is shown:
  - “Induction completed successfully”

---

## Compliance Capture
Each worker session records:
- Session ID
- Selected language
- Timestamps
- Confirmations
- Device type (basic)
- IP address (if required for audit)

No personal account is required for MVP.

---

## MVP Constraints
- No login
- No user profile
- No offline mode
- Smartphone only (desktop not required)
- Focus on clarity, compliance, and speed

---

## Future Enhancements (Not MVP)
- Audio narration
- Identity verification
- Offline mode
- Saved worker profiles
- Reusable induction history
